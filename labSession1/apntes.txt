calculate the translation matrix


compose a matrix Pc1 which project 3d points to 2d points

Pc1 = K * Canonical * c1Tw

To calculate a line with two points ==> Lab = Xa x Xb

To calculate the point where 2 lines meet ==> P12 = L1 x L2

To compute the vector in 3D defined by two points ==> Vector_AB = (X_B - X_A, 0) ==> 4 rows

With SVD we will get the plane we will have to solve a linear system of homogeneous equation, with SVD (Singular values descomposition)

We want to get the kernel in order to solve linear ecuations.

Ax=0 ==> solution = svd(A)
